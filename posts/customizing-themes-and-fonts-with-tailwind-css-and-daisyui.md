Tailwind is awesome n' all but it can be a bit of a fiddle to start
customising the default theme. I've spent a bit of time customising
this site to use local fonts above the default used in Tailwind. In
this post I'll go over adding in new fonts for tailwind and daisyUI.

daisyUI is a plugin for Tailwind that makes it easy to customise the
default theme and add new themes. It also adds a bunch of new
components that you can use in your projects.
