This is a how-to guide for adding a contact form to your SvelteKit
site using Airtable to store the submissions and notify you when there
is a new submission.

This is an update to the [previous post] I did on this, the recent
changes to how you interact with the Airtable API means that I get a
chance to revisit this and make it a little more current.

The previous post goes over creating a new SvelteKit project and
setting up the Airtable base, so I won't go over that again here.

## With an event handler
