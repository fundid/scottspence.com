Tailwind is cool, right? Really configurable as well, I wanted to add
some gradient animation to a project of mine. So did a search and
found this awesome post by [Victor Yoalli] on how to do it! Thanks
Victor!

I've basically taken Victor's code and adjusted it for use with daisUI
to apply to the effect to some text rather than to a div as with
Victor's example.
