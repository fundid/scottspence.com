Real quick! This was a dumb idea I had when I created the repo for
this in 2018 and never got around to doing anything with until
yesterday! ðŸ˜‚

**Tl;Dr**: It's a list of CSS filters that you can apply to an image
to see what effect they have.

I got the idea from [this repo], which in turn got the idea from [Una
Kravets].

Essentially, it applies the [CSS filter] class to the image using one
of the filters from the [list], like this:

```html
<figure class="filter-1977">
  <img
    src="https://picsum.photos/400/400"
    alt="random picsum asset"
  />
</figure>
```

Rather than list out all the filters, individually I thought I'd add
them to a select element and use Svelte's data binding to apply the
filter to the image.

## The process

So to get the filters [list] into the project, I created a new project
with `pnpm create svelte` then created a `instagram.css` file in the
`src` directory and copied the list into it.

Then I can import the CSS file into the `src/routes/+page.svelte` file
and use the CSS filter class names in a `figure` element.

```svelte
<script>
  import '../instagram.css';
</script>

<figure class="filter-1977">
  <img
    src="https://picsum.photos/400/400"
    alt="random picsum asset"
  />
</figure>
```

Cool! But I want to be able to select the filter from a list. So I
create a `filters.svelte`, `select` component and add the filters to
the `option` element using the Svelte `{each}` loop.

```svelte
<script>
  let filtersList = [
    'looooong',
    'list',
    'of',
    'filters',
  ];
</script>

<select>
  {#each filtersList as filter}
    <option value={filter}>
      <span>{filter}</span>
    </option>
  {/each}
</select>
```

Cool, so, now I have a list of filters, I'll idd that into my
`+page.svelte` and I can choose the filters. Sweet!

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import Filters from '$lib/components/filters.svelte';
  import '../instagram.css';
</script>

<figure class="filter-1977">
  <img
    src="https://picsum.photos/400/400"
    alt="random picsum asset"
  />
</figure>

<Filters />
```

Aight, now, I need to apply the filter from the select onto the image,
right?

So, I need to ge the value of the select and apply it to the `figure`,
how do I get the value of the select over to the `+page.svelte`?

By using data binding!

## Bind the select value to a variable

I did a post about [Data Binding in Svelte] a while back if you want
to get a full understanding of what's going on here.

What I need to do is create a variable in the `filters.svelte` file to
bind the value of the select to.

So, essentially `export let value = ''` is the value being passed into
the component.

```svelte
<script>
  let filtersList = [
    'looooong',
    'list',
    'of',
    'filters',
  ];
  export let value = ''
</script>

<select
  bind:value={value}
>
  {#each filtersList as filter}
    <option value={filter}>
      <span>{filter}</span>
    </option>
  {/each}
</select>
```

In the `+page.svelte` file, I can create an `optionValue` variable and
bind that to the `Filters` component.

When the value changes on the page, that value is passed to the
`Filters` component.

I can then apply the `optionValue` to the `figure` element `class`
using some backticks to apply the class.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import Filters from '$lib/components/filters.svelte';
  import '../instagram.css';
  let optionValue = '';
</script>

<figure class={`filter-${optionValue}`}>
  <img src="https://picsum.photos/400/400" alt="" />
</figure>

<Filters bind:value={optionValue} />
```

That's it! Now, when I select a filter from the list, it will apply to
the `figure` element.

If you're interested you can check out the code over on [GitHub].
