### Work

Working with [Storyblok] as a developper relations engineer, creating
content that helps remove friction and to educate in the headless CMS
space.

I'm using SvelteKit on a daily basis and getting involved with the
community on using it.

### Play

I've been playing the Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom on the Switch since
release.
