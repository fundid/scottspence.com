### Work

Working as a relations engineer for [Storyblok], creating content that
helps remove friction and to educate in the headless CMS space.

I'm using SvelteKit on a daily basis and getting involved with the
community on using it.

### Play

I'm still playing Borderlands 3! With the Legendary collection on the
Switch I'm now playing Borderlands 2 again!!

Try to get out of the house twice a day to go for a walk and see the
outside.
